My mama will only leave me debts.
My papa said he wouldn't leave a thing.
My grandma will leave me none, since she has none.
My grandpa will leave me his walking cane, and some of his hats.
But all of them will leave me, one of this days.
And all of the stories and memories we shared.
Will be remembered and tresured as well.
For there is no greatest value, than the love that we shared.
